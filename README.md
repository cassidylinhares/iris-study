# Iris Study: Classification
### The Data Set:
The Data contains the sepal length and width and the petal length and width for 150 iris plants which are of 3 differents kinds of species of iris
### Purpose:
Using the iris data set, the points are clustered and used to make a decison tree. Similarities, differences, and findings are noted between both algorithms and the data fed in
### Findings: 
The clustering showed definitives clusters for the data and when compared to the actual clusters for each species revealed that the petal data may be the better choice for use of classification. The decision trees showed the same results.
